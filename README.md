# Throttle

A small client-server utility, that throttles commands sent to it from multiple
async sources.

Features:

- if receiving multiple instances of an already running command, only one other instance will be executed, after the current one finishes, by running each command in it's own process
- allows chaining commands, each command in the chain is still correctly throttled
- repeats failed commands in configurable intervals
- configurable notification callback for failed commands
- configuration allows handling spammed notifications from flaky commands (e.g because of flaky networks)
- regex based on the fly rewrite of commands

## Social

Development and support happens on
[sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~ferdinandyb/throttle/), but there's a mirror on
[github](https://github.com/ferdinandyb/throttle) for convenience and
discoverability. You can also star there to show your interest/appreciation.

## Rationale

Although `throttle` doesn't care what you want to run with it, it was written
to solve issue's I had with syncing my email properly. It resolves the
following problems I had:

- Correct, on-demand, responsive syncing of a mail account with [mbsync](https://isync.sourceforge.io/):
  Instead of running `mbsync account-inbox` every X seconds (a waste of
  resources), I trigger the command via hooks in [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/)
  whenever I make an operation in my inbox, or via
  [goimapnotify](https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify) when something changes
  on the server. Sync `mbsync` locks the folder it operates on, running multiple
  instances of `mbsync account-inbox` could leave you with a half-synced state.
  Practical example is receiving 10 emails in a short time: that's 10 triggers
  from `goimapnotify`, but only the first couple of emails will be synced.
  `goimapnotify`'s [wait](https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify/-/issues/10)
  setting sacrifices responsiveness and still doesn't guarantee a correctly
  synced state.
- Remapping aerc hooks running `mbsync $AERC_ACCOUNT-$AERC_FOLDER` to the correct `mbsync` channel.
- Every sync operation with `mbsync` needs to be followed up by a `notmuch new`,
  but `notmuch` also locks when running, which could lead to inconsistency
  between a `maildir` and a `notmuch` view of my emails. Chaining them via
  `throttle` makes sure `notmuch new` is executed after each `mbsync` operation,
  but only as much as actually needed.

- Executing `notify-send` in sync scripts after every failure was annoying to
  set up and quite spammy when connections got flaky (which is always when
  resuming from a sleep). Those executions were also "lost". Throttle will
  retry and can be configured to only send a notification on the second
  failure, which in practice has removed the spam alltogether.


## Getting started

Install with

```
pipx install git+https://git.sr.ht/~ferdinandyb/throttle
```

Start server with

```
throttle --server
```

And send a command to the server (via unix socket):

```
throttle mbsync inbox
```

`throttle` should now run `mbsync inbox` for you. If you spam the above command
a couple of hundred times before the first one finishes, `throttle` will queue
up a single other instance of `mbsync inbox` after the first one finished.


## Usage

```
usage: throttle [-h] [-s | -j JOB] [-k] [-o ORIGIN] [--LOGLEVEL {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --server          Start server.
  -j JOB, --job JOB     Explicitly give job to execute, can be given multiple times, in that case, they will be run consecutively.
  -k, --kill            Kill a previously started job.
  -o ORIGIN, --origin ORIGIN
                        Set the origin of the message, which might be useful in tracking logs.
  --LOGLEVEL {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        Set loglevel.
```

First start a server with `throttle --server`. It will log to
`$XDG_STATE/throttle/throttle.log`, which should default to
`~/.local/state/throttle/throttle.log`.

To start a job run `throttle my command` which will run `my command`. You can
make it explicit by running `throttle --job "my command"`. Multiple `--job`
flags will execute the command successively. Any dangling parameters will be
scooped up for a last command so

```
throttle hello --job "my command" world
```

is equivalent to

```
throttle --job "my command" --job "hello world"
```

although you probably should not do this. Anyhow, this will first execute `my
command` and if it succeeds, it will run then run `hello world`. When running
multiple commands, they are executed serially.

If one `throttle --job "hello world"` errors out and you don't want it to run
indefinitely, you can stop it alltogether by `throttle --kill --job "hello
world"`. Note, that this does not save you from restarting it with `throttle
--job "hello world"` again.

Practical usage of a multiple commands would be something like:

```
throttle --job "mbsync personal-inbox" --job "notmuch new"
```

## Configuration

Configuration happens in `$XDG_CONFIG/throttle/config.toml`.

Example config:

```
task_timeout = 30
retry_sequence = [5,15,30,60,120,300,900]
notification_cmd = 'notify-send --urgency={urgency} --app-name="throttle" "{job} ({origin})" "({errcode}): {msg}"'

notify_on_counter = 2
job_timeout = 600

[[filters]]
pattern = '^sleep \d$'
substitute = "sleep 10"

[[filters]]
pattern = '^sleep \d\d'
substitute = "sleep 15"

[[filters]]
pattern = '^mbsync (\w+)-(?!(inbox|archive|sent|drafts)$).+'
substitute = 'mbsync \1-folders'
```

- `task_timeout`: how long to wait before cleaning up a process with no more incoming commands (probably no need to change this)
- `retry_sequence`: list of seconds to successively wait if a command fails (e.g. no internet connection), the last element is retried in perpetuity
- `notification_cmd`: in case of a command failure, this command is called. See below for template keys
- `notify_on_counter`: how many failures before a notification should be sent
- `job_timeout`: how many seconds to let a job run, before timeouting it
- filters: each `filters` section defines a specific transformation, the first matching one is applied. `pattern` is checked against the command and if it matches, replaced by `substitute` using regex substitution (python `re.sub({pattern},{substitute},{input})` is used). In case of multiple commands in one call, it is done per command separately.

Key that can be used in `notification_cmd`:

- job: a job (single `--job`)
- urgency: this is always "urgent" for now
- errcode: errorcode if it exists (set to -1000 if error code was not returned)
- msg: usually stderr of subprocess
